# When you can't ReadMe

[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description

My motivation for this app was to streamline the process of making quality readme.md files. When this app is run it will go through a series of questions for the user to answer that will end up generating the new readme in a assets folder for them to copy and paste into there new app. This app will save time and give you a consistent layout.
